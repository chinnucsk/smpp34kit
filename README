smpp34kit is supposed to be a collection of tools and application
to help out a SMPP 3.4 developer.

It is initially starting out as a simple PDU generator over a socket 
connection to allow me to test my smpp34 erlang implementation properly.

Any other tools will be added here, but there is no overriding rule
guiding its evolution
